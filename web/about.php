				<h2>some more about me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a <? echo myAge(); ?> years old Dutchman living and working in Berlin, Germany. Originally I'm from Eindhoven, in the south of the Netherlands, where I was born and raised. Before moving to Berlin in 2016 I have been living in lovely Rotterdam for 4 years where I've worked at design agency Zinnebeeld until it's dissolution end 2015.
				</p>
				<h2>professional</h2>
				<p>
					Developer with over <? echo myAge('2001-05-01'); ?> years of experience building web based products. I have worked as a web developer for design agencies, a communications bureau and also as a freelancer. I care about the complete development process. I am not only involved in technical realisation but I am also capable of playing a role in the design process as well as running agile projects with clients. I like to be involved in the projects I work on.	
				</p> 
				<p>
					Especially while working at my latest employer, design agency <a href="http://www.zinnebeeld.nl/" target="_blank">zinnebeeld</a> in Rotterdam, I have found the opportunity to develop myself beyond writing code and gained a lot of experience in  the full process of project realisation.
